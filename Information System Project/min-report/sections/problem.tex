In this project, we are expected to extract a subset of samples of big data. Assume there are $m$ samples ($45\leq m\leq54$), 
any $n$ ($7 \leq n\leq 25$) samples out of these m samples are selected. 
There are $C_{n}^{m}$ groups of $n$ samples. From one of these groups of n samples, we randomly selected $k$ ($4 \leq k \leq 7$) samples to form some groups. 
So there will be $C_{n}^{k}$ groups of k samples selected. There are at least \textbf{ONE} group of k samples, 
in which $s$ ($3 \leq s \leq 7$) samples have been selected from the $j$ (where $s \leq j \leq k$) samples.
Among these groups of $k$ samples, we would like to optimize them by selecting ONLY some of them.
