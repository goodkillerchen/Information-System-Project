This project is based on the theoretical direction of \textbf{ME001} subject and 
combines some knowledge of data structure and mathematic, 
including optimal algorithms and combinatorics. But there are no correct understanding of 
some part of difficult and profound mathematic problems like fuzzy set.
Authors point out about converse decimal digits to the binary make the big data abstraction in order to descend the time complexity.
Besides, authors have already comprehend the core of program language \textbf{C\#} 
with utilizing \textbf{. Net Framework}. By using program, authors realize the process 
from theory to practice reflecting the theoretical view of unity of knowledge and practice.
When writing large-scale projects, people often need cooperation and collaborative development, 
authors use \textbf{GitHub} for collaborative development and submit own patch code to collaborator's repository.
In this article, we will utilize ideas to achieve team cooperation on \textbf{GitHub}.
The last but not least, the goal of the future study and work is to work harder to learn this knowledge, 
in order to enrich, improve our level.
