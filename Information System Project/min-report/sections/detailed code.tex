\subsection{Realization of Modifying DB files}

As the request said, we need output the group of $k$ samples and corresponding result in DB files.
First of all, we choose an OOP program language \textbf{C\#} 
which runs on\textbf{. Net framework} and\textbf{. Net core}(completely open source, cross platform) 
to help realize combine with modifying DB files.

Depending on \textbf{C\#} powerful library and interface, we can apply our algorithm source code on GUI platform,
and realizing the operation of creating new files(Code.\hyperref[code:create]{1}) 
as well as exporting result into corresponding files(Code.\hyperref[code:insert]{2}).

\label{code:insert}\lstinputlisting[language=csh]{code/insertTable.cs}

\subsection{Multi-Threading}
    
We adopt multi-threading programming way. We split the program into two parts, which are the GUI part and the 
calculation part. In this way, even if the program haven't figured out, the window of the program won't be stick.
The specific implemented function is bound in \hyperref[code:multi]{button2\_Click}.
