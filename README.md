## Preface

It is known that the amount of data has been increasing tremendously in the last few years due to the ease of accessing to internet, cheap or inexpensive mass storage devices, the ease of transferring data through internet, communication lines and digital data are used in every walk of life. Nowadays, these big data have been used for numerous areas.  

## Introduction

In this project, we are expected to extract a subset of samples of big data. And more specific requests offered by professor can been seen in [Mini Project.pdf](/Information%20System%20Project/Mini%20Project.pdf). In the following, we propose one method to resolve the problem.  

## Algorithm

The cores of algorithm are **Subsets** by binary, **Combination** and **Greedy Algorithm** to Calculate the Set Coveraged.

## GUI and User Guide

The detailed information of programming are listed in table:
|Attribute|Content|
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Operation System|Windows SDK edition: 10.0|
|Integrated Development| Environment Visual Studio 2019(v142)|
|Solution Settings Release| in x86 Platform|
|Optimization| O2 optimize|
|Programming Language| C# |
|Framework|. Net framework 4.7.2|

Just required to follow the steps in [Project in ME001 â€“ Sampling system.pdf] to run the program.
And the initial layout in figure below:

## Sample Output

In order to make the operation more smooth, all the program environment
and settings are completed and included in the file package. You can download the folder and click on *Information System Project.exe* to use the visible GUI.

The output in window can be seen in figure below:
